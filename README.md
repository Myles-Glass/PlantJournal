# PlantJournal
<b>To Use:</b> Unzip the github project to a folder. Open Android Studio. Go to File -> New -> Import Project. Then choose the specific project you want to import and then click Next->Finish.<br>

<b>The App:</b> Over the Summer, I got into indoor plants and got a little overwhelmed with the different levels of care each plant needed, so I decided to make an app to keep track of all of it. In it's current state, the user touches the "Add Plant" button and fills out information about the plant they want to add. The information is then stored on a file. The user can then touch the name of the plant and view the information. See "PJ1.png" for an example.<br>
The code is located in app/src/main/first.

<b>Current State:</b> Adds plants to a list with information the user provides. <br>
Saves the information to a text file on the phone.<br>
Working on a delete button.<br>
UI is placeholder.
