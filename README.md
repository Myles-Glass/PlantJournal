# PlantJournal
<b>The App:</b> Over the Summer, I got into indoor plants and got a little overwhelemd with the different levels of care each plant needed, so I decided to make an app to keep track of all of it.

<b>Current State:</b> Adds plants to a list with information the user provides. <br>
Saves the information to a text file on the phone.<br>
Working on a delete button.<br>
UI is placeholder.
